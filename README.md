# Soil-Moisture-Sensor
**The Soil Moisture Sensor** measures the water content in soil by detecting changes in electrical capacitance. As soil moisture increases, capacitance changes and affects the output voltage — producing a higher voltage when dry and a lower voltage when moist. This analog signal can be read and interpreted by a microcontroller.

This capacitive-type sensor offers better durability and long-term reliability compared to traditional resistive models, making it well-suited for outdoor or long-term agricultural use.

## Advantages of capacitive-type sensors:
- More durable than resistive-type models
- Resistant to corrosion
- Provides higher accuracy in some soil conditions

## This sensor is suitable for:
- Automatic plant watering systems
- Smart farming and precision agriculture
- IoT-based environmental monitoring projects
